Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id : 10000 
ii. Hours = business_id : 1562  
iii. Category = business_id : 2643 
iv. Attribute = business_id : 1115 
v. Review = id : 10000; business_id : 8090; user_id : 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id : 493 
vii. Photo = business_id : 6493; id:10000 
viii. Tip = business_id : 3979; user_id : 537;
ix. User = id : 10000 
x. Friend = user_id : 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id: 2780 

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT * FROM user WHERE
										id is NULL OR
										name is NULL OR
										review_count is NULL OR
										yelping_since is NULL OR
										useful is NULL OR
										funny is NULL OR
										cool is NULL OR
										fans is NULL OR
										average_stars is NULL OR
										compliment_hot is NULL OR
										compliment_more is NULL OR
										compliment_profile is NULL OR
										compliment_cute is NULL OR
										compliment_list is NULL OR
										compliment_note is NULL OR
										compliment_plain is NULL OR
										compliment_cool is NULL OR
										compliment_funny is NULL OR
										compliment_writer is NULL;
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082 
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results: Not necessarily, as the quantity of fans is also affected by when they began yelping. Sara is an exception since she has a high number of reviews and has been on Yelp for a long time, yet she only has 50 fans.
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: yes

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT count(*) FROM review WHERE text LIKE "%love%" OR text LIKE "%hate%";
	

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT * FROM user ORDER BY fans DESC LIMIT 10;

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
   Ans: Yes. For food category in Las Vegas, the 4 star(Between 4 and 5 star) business stays for like 9 hours almost where 2.5 star(between 2 and 3 star) business stays more than 4 star business(more than 10 hours almost)


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Ans: Yes. For food category in Las Vegas, the business which has 4 star has something like 30 reviews and the business which has below 3 star has something like 6 reviews       
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
     Ans: For food category in Las Vegas, The 4-5 stars business is located in the South Eastern Avenue neighborhood, and the 2-3 stars business is located in the Eastside Tropicana neighborhood. Since the one in the
	South Eastern neighborhood has more reviews and higher rating of stars, it could be possible that the South Eastern neighborhood cares more about food, which causes
	better restaurants to want to be located there and have more customers writing reviews about the businesses. Or it can also be happen that there is no better resturent in that location so the food business there have grown much better as there is no further competition.
	However, the sample size of data is too small to confirm that whether or not the inference is true.

							AND (business.stars BETWEEN 2.0 AND 3.0 OR business.stars BETWEEN 4.0 AND 5.0);

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
	What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
	List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The one which is open has more average star(3.67900943396 ) than the other which is closed(3.52039473684).
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The one which is open has more average number of reviews(31) than the other which is closed(23)
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis: SELECT is_open, 
							COUNT(DISTINCT id) as Total_Id, 
							SUM(review_count)/COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS average_review, 
							AVG(stars) as average_stars 
							FROM business 
							group by is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset 
	and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. 
These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative 
and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   Ans: Predicting to run a specific category business in a specific location so that the business can grow much better
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
   Ans: To start a successful business, we must need to know about the demand of a business in a particular location. Like it is good to open a Tea Stall where people love tea mostly.
		But it is not good to open a tea stall where there are many good restaurants for good tea or people do not love tea. We will not be able to grow the business successfully then. So,
		we must have to analyze the demand of a business of a particular locations. For this, first we need the data about a business, their category, their locations at which they got most reviews and big stars. Then we can analysis the data for further 
		predictions. After running our query on the yelp dataset, we can see that motors business is high rated in Highland neighborhood at Las Vegas. Also we can see that framing, food and plumbing category business is high rated 
		at Middleton, Oakville and Henderson City. But the business stars does not correlate with review count that much. Maybe the business panel is maintaining there quality so that's why people do not have anything about complaining. Or it can be happen that the business is not attracting the people 
		much in that area, maybe it will grow later. Also we can see that hours correlate with both stars and review count. The business which opens for more hours have good stars and much reviews count than the business open for few hours.
		So, we can say that, the business in the particular location started must be open for long times and have to maintain their quality. From the data, we can predict that if a person wants to give 
		car wash center, he can choose Phoenix city as it is high demandable there.
